# Cion Compiler

This is the old implementation of the Cion programming language compiler.

It is deprecated in favor of the newer implementation in Rust that can be found [here](https://github.com/Robbepop/cionc).

## Functionality

 - Efficiently parse Cion files and build up an AST
 - Pretty print the AST on the console
