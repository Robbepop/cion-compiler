ToDo list for Cion Compiler

- put source files in associated folders as their include header files
	- add error token type and output it in the lexer whenever an error appeared
	- make existing code use the new ErrorHandler in order to output
	  and handle errors and warning while lexing or parsing
	- add type information to all AST expression nodes
	- implement symbol table for Cion Compiler
	- create semantic check passes:
		1. fill SymbolTable
		2. check declared before defined
		3. set types
		4. check type matching
